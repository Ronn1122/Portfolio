    <h1>About</h1>
    
<p>I’m a product manager with 4+ years of experience across B2B SaaS and eCommerce, currently based in Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>I currently work at Deputy, where I’ve led the rebuild of our leave management system and now lead the Communications platform team (Chat, Newsfeed, Notifications). I care deeply about platform thinking, value delivery, clear UX, and real-world storytelling.</p>
<p>On the side, I write fiction, book reviews, and plan to build a newsletter around tech x culture x writing.</p>
<p>I’m always up for a coffee or a call — reach out at <a href="mailto:raunaqbahl@gmail.com">raunaqbahl@gmail.com</a></p>
